    <h2>Chapter 5 to 7</h2>

    <p>
        This week we study Objects in JavaScript, objects are a set of properties and values â€‹â€‹related to each other, properties that are functions are called methods, the name of a property can be a string of characters, even an empty one. The property value
        can be any value that we can use in JavaScript, except undefined.<br><br> To create an object we can do it through literal notation, through a constructor, and the new keyword. You can access the properties and methods of an object through
        the notation of periods and brackets.<br><br> In this reading, I better understood the JavaScript or JSON object notation files since they are objects created employing literal notation that can exchange information with websites and are currently
        widely used for information exchange<br><br> We also study the Mathobject which is an integrated object that has several properties that represent mathematical constants, as well as methods that carry out a series of common mathematical operations.
        All properties and methods of the Mathobject are immutable and cannot be changed.<br><br> Objects allow us to keep functionality and related information together in the same place and in this way it is possible to have an orderly code.<br><br>

    <h2>Chapter 6 The Document Object Model or the DOM.</h2>

    <p>
        The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents that allow a structured representation of the document and how they can access it to change its structure, content, and style.<br><br> We can access the DOM of a document through the
        console using commands that interact with the elements of the web page and thus see the results.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 7 Events.</h2>

    <p>
        Events are part of the DOM and are the link between the web page and user interactions. These occur when the user interacts with the web page, there are many kinds of events and we can detect these events and invoke a function for when this occurs, there
        are many ways to detect an event and program how it will respond to such an event.<br><br> Below we have several examples of this.
