        <h2>Remembering Userâ€™s Info</h2>

        <p>This week we study how to create an interactive communication with the user allowing 
           him to enter data and obtain results according to his data, the information entered 
           by the user is identified with the input tag and the results that are shown to the 
           user are identified with the output tag, these techniques are called IO.<br><br>

           We also learned how the user can find, edit, save and display the information they 
           want through the creation of buttons, these buttons are identified with the <botton> 
           tag and with JavaScript we can give it a function to perform the actions we want.<br><br>
            
           The creation of variables are very important because it is there where the 
           information to be used in an action of a function is stored, it takes the information 
           from a place such as user input and stores them to be used to produce a result and this 
           is achieved with JavaScript.</p>
