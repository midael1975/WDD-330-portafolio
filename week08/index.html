    <h2>Transforms and Transitions</h2>

    <p>The CSS3 property allows you to translate, rotate, scale and / or skew any element on the page. We can manipulate the appearance of an element using transform functions. The property value is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that
        will be applied in the order in which they are provided.
    </p><br><br>

    <p>Translation The translation functions allow you to move items left, right, up or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of declaring y, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. When you use a translation function,
        you are moving elements without affecting the flow of the document. Unlike, which allows you to place an item against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated item can only be moved relative to its current position.
        position: relative; top left position: relative.</p><br><br>

    <p>We also have the scaling that allows moving an element between the axis and the x axis, the rotation, the transition, the skew and the animation that provide us with many tools to create more interactive sites and many lighter especially for For those
        devices that do not have as much processing power, we must be judicious in what to place the animations or any of those tools so that the website is not saturated with that content to such an extent that the purpose of the same is lost.</p><br><br>

    <h2>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>

    <p>With CSS3 we can be more independent when creating our own images if we depend on downloading them from the web or using already loaded images, with these tools we can start our imagination and create different images that can make our website much
        lighter to load in addition to giving it the touch of originality of our imagination.</p><br><br>

    <p>With these tools and their manipulation we can turn our website into a real canvas where we can draw, paint and create images and give it a friendly, original and also light aspect for the user.</p>
