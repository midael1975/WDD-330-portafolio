        <h2>Chapter 2 to 4</h2>

        <p>
            This time I read chapters 2, 3, and 4 and I was able to review and learn how to 
            write in JavaScript, that is, its syntax, declaring a variable and constants, 
            creating strings and comments, among other principles that govern writing in 
            JavaScript. . As we learned in last class we must learn how to communicate with 
            computers since they are stupid and do not understand our language.<br><br>

            We also studied the creation of matrices, methods, and loops, one of the novel 
            principles that I learned was the creation of sets and maps, although their 
            function is explained in the text I have doubts about when and how to apply the 
            sets and maps, that is to say, which is it's the practical and real application 
            in web creation.<br><br>

            The most interesting and most necessary topic for me is the creation of functions, 
            functions allow the page to be interactive with the user by allowing it to be part 
            of the result of the page, however, we need to completely decipher the logic that 
            we need to establish for the creation of a function, something I learned is that 
            there are 3 different ways to declare a function which are: declaration of 
            functions, expressions of functions and a new form that is called arrow notation, 
            for me the easiest to apply and understand is the declaration of functions since it 
            teaches and has a more understandable form of the code and its operation within the code. 
            Applying the expression form of functions does not work for me and I need to better 
            understand the logical way to write this type of function to get it to work 
            properly.<br><br>

            During the week I will study more in-depth the application of these different ways 
            of declaring a function, especially the expression of functions and arrow 
            notation.<br><br>
