    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>

    <p>
        The JavaScript debugger allows you to step through JavaScript code and examine or modify its state to help locate errors. It is essential to catch the errors early to save time in the implementation of the program and save time in the search for them.<br><br>        DevTools provides a lot of different tools for different tasks, such as changing CSS, profiling page load performance, and monitoring network requests. The Sources panel is where you debug JavaScript.<br><br> Open DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I
        (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows, Linux). This shortcut opens the Console panel. Click the Sources tab.<br><br> The Sources panel<br><br> The Sources panel UI has 3 parts: Figure 4. The 3 parts of the Sources panel UI<br><br> The File Navigator
        pane. Every file that the page requests is listed here. The Code Editor pane. After selecting a file in the File Navigator pane, the contents of that file are displayed here. The JavaScript Debugging pane. Various tools for inspecting the page's
        JavaScript. If your DevTools window is wide, this pane is displayed to the right of the Code Editor pane.<br><br> A common method for debugging a problem like this is to insert a lot of console.log() statements into the code, in order to inspect
        values as the script executes<br><br> The console.log() method may get the job done, but breakpoints can get it done faster. A breakpoint lets you pause your code in the middle of its execution, and examine all values at that moment in time. Breakpoints
        have a few advantages over the console.log() method:<br><br> With console.log(), you need to manually open the source code, find the relevant code, insert the console.log() statements, and then reload the page in order to see the messages in the
        Console. With breakpoints, you can pause on the relevant code without even knowing how the code is structured. In your console.log() statements you need to explicitly specify each value that you want to inspect. With breakpoints, DevTools shows
        you the values of all variables at that moment in time. Sometimes there are variables affecting your code that you're not even aware of.<br><br> In short, breakpoints can help you find and fix bugs faster than the console.log() method In the JavaScript
        Debugging pane, click Event Listener Breakpoints to expand the section. DevTools reveals a list of expandable event categories, such as Animation and Clipboard.<br><br> Next to the Mouse event category, click Expand Expand. DevTools reveals a
        list of mouse events, such as click and mousedown. Each event has a checkbox next to it.<br><br> Check the click checkbox. DevTools is now set up to automatically pause when any click event listener executes.<br><br> Back on the demo, click Add
        Number 1 and Number 2 again. DevTools pauses the demo and highlights a line of code in the Sources panel. DevTools should be paused on this line of code:<br><br> function onClick() { If you're paused on a different line of code, press Resume Script
        Execution ALT_TEXT_HERE until you're paused on the correct line.<br><br> Event Listener Breakpoints are just one of many types of breakpoints available in DevTools. It's worth memorizing all the different types, because each type ultimately helps
        you debug different scenarios as quickly as possible. See Pause Your Code With Breakpoints to learn when and how to use each type.
