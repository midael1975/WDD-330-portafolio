    <h2>Validating Form</h2><br>

    <p>The validation of the data in a format is a common and healthy practice in the creation of web pages, the validation that is done in the browser is called user-side validation and in the server it is called server-side validation. The validation must
        guarantee the good experience of the user in the filling, when capturing an invalid entry it must be ensured to show the user exactly where the error exists, what the error is and how to fix it. An efficient practice in validating formats is to
        show the user exactly what is required for the input to be valid.
    </p><br><br>

    <p>The validation can be done with the characteristics of HTML5 and they can be highlighted and stylized with CSS but, in addition, JavaScript can be used to perform the validation, especially when we need to customize this validation, through JavaScript
        we can customize the error messages in the filling of the forms and also we can with JavaScript check the values that the user enters before being sent. This makes the form more specific in what it expects from the client and allows a better user
        experience with the form by being well informed of the data that is required of it and how it is required.</p><br><br>

    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2><br>

    <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface to access and manipulate parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch () method that provides a simple and logical way to asynchronously fetch resources over
        the network.</p>

    <p>The simplest use of fetch () takes one argument, the path to the resource you want to get, and returns a promise that contains the response (a Response object).</p><br><br>

    <p>This is just an HTTP response, not the actual JSON. To extract the content of the JSON body from the response, we use the json () method (defined in the Bodymixin, which is implemented by the Request and Response objects).</p>

    <p>We can use fetch () to get data from an API. Fetch is finely tuned for GET requests, but you can use all other types of requests, change the headers, and send data. To do this, you need to set your object and pass it as the second argument to the
        fetch function.</p>
