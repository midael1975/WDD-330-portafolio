    <h2>Further Functions</h2>

    <p>The functions in JavaScript are procedures with a set of declarations that perform a task or calculate a value, for this to work in this way it must take an input and return an output that of course keeps relation to each other, the functions can
        do their work inside of the area that is built.<br><br> Call functions<br> Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it simply names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.<br><br> Calling the function actually
        performs the specified actions with the specified parameters. For example, if you define the square function, you could call it like this:<br><br> square (5);<br> The above declaration calls the function with an argument of 5. The function executes
        its declarations and returns the value 25.<br><br> Call and apply methods<br> The method can be used to set the value from within a function to an object that is provided as the first argument. call () this<br><br> In the following example, the
        function refers to a non-specific object called that has a property called: sayHello () this name<br><br> function sayHello () { return `Hello, my name is $ {this.name}`; }
        <br><br> We can create some objects that have a property, then use the method to invoke the function, supplying each object as an argument. This will then take the value of in the function: name call () sayHello () this.<br><br> In this chapter
        it is very interesting how specific and broad the functions can be, there is no way to learn this language without practicing and learning its syntax since the way of expressing the instructions follows principles but that for now does not They
        are intuitive and must be learned through the application.
        <br><br> Writing a function is an art of logic, and to be able to know which is the right code for each situation, you certainly need a lot of practice.</p>

    <h2>Ajax</h2>

    <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated
        in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run. The use of Ajax revolutionized how websites worked, and ushered in a new age of web applications. Web pages were no longer static, but dynamic applications.
        <br><br> Clients and Servers<br> The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the
        request and sends back a response to the client.<br><br> JavaScript was originally designed as a client-side scripting language, meaning that it ran locally in the browser, adding dynamic features to the web page that was returned from the server.
        Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.<br><br> Consequently, a server is required when requesting
        resources using Ajax. Typically this involves using a server-side language, such as PHP, Ruby, Node.js, or .NET to serve the data response following an Ajax request (usually from a back-end database). To practice using Ajax, you can either set
        up a local development server on your own computer, or request the files from an external website that uses cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in order to avoid the same-origin policy that browsers enforce. All the examples in this chapter can
        be run without having to set up a local development server, although it may be worth looking into if you wish to do a lot of Ajax or server-side development.<br><br> Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full
        page reload, can be used for communicating with external APIs.Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.<br><br>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON
