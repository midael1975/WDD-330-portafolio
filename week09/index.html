    <h2>The window object</h2>

    <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though, this method is unreliable).
        We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if youâ€™re into annoying your users.
    </p><br><br>

    <p>Cookies are small files that are stored locally on a user's computer. This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to another. Therefore, every time a user visits a page, nothing is remembered about previous visits. Cookies
        can be used to avoid this problem by storing information that can later be retrieved between requests.</p><br><br>

    <p>Cookies can be used to personalize the browsing experience of a user, storing preferences, authentication and user tracking.</p><br><br>

    <p>The BOM can be used to create animations of objects as well as cancel them and call functions to execute or cancel them in a certain time, improving the user experience with the page.</p>

    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>

    <p>The HTML5.1 is the latest version, and this allows the use of API by JavaScript, as for the example the data attribute allows embedding custom data in a web page that can be used with JavaScript and improve the user experience. ...</p><br><br>

    <p>APIs allow us to do various things in the interactive design of websites, for example they allow us to store key-value pairs on user devices in a similar way as cookies but without storage limitations, it allows us to geolocate devices, and there
        are the web worker APIs that allow us to perform computational tasks in the background so that the other applications can continue to function without the risk of stopping the program.</p>

    <p>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the Internet and allow two-way communication in real time. There is also an API that helps media playback</p>
