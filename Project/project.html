    <p>
        The application aims to provide information on the different countries of the world. It has the dark mode feature, and it has a search engine where the user writes the country of interest and the country will appear with its flag and different information
        about it.<br><br> The characteristics is that the application is organized by grid and is designed to be responsive in 4 views, also create a view for when a specific country is selected. Use the form to create the input where the name
        of the country to be searched would be placed. Use variables to define the colors and @meanings to define the styles on different screens.<br><br> 1. Define the html and there create a div that would be the container for the API information.<br>        2. Determine which API to work with and copy it into the project folder so as not to depend on internet speed.<br> 3. Create the app.js file where I extract the information from the API through Foreach we can go through the entire array and through
        the innerHtml we can show the information we want.<br> 4. Create a form.js file to take the data from the API in app.js and when the user clicks then search and display the element to search.<br> 5. Then we make a filter by region so that the
        client can search for the elements of that region.<br><br> If I modified my application from the original and tried to make a different app, I continued using APIs but more robust and different information.<br><br> One of the problems to be solved
        was how to extract the data from the API and perform a filter for the search of a country. The way I found to solve it was to link the data from the app.js file with the files.<br><br> In this project apply the use of calling functions, of using
        API to obtain information, using JavaScript to create the html structure and the events listener.<br><br> In the app we can see how by typing a name of a country and clicking then we turn on the start of functions that quickly search for the desired
        information and become more interactive with the events listener, we also use JavaScript code separately to master certain functions but at the same time they are connected.
